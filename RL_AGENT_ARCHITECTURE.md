- **Multi-player Support**: Handles 2-4 player games with configurable opponents

### Environment Configuration

```python
env_config = {
    "enemies": [
        RandomPlayer(Color.RED),      # Opponent 1
        RandomPlayer(Color.ORANGE),   # Opponent 2  
        RandomPlayer(Color.WHITE)     # Opponent 3
    ],
    "map_type": "BASE",              # Standard Catan board
    "representation": "vector"        # Feature vector representation
}
```

### Observation Space Details

The 1,002-dimensional observation vector includes:

#### Player-Specific Features (per player):
- **Resource Cards**: WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE quantities
- **Development Cards**: KNIGHT, ROAD_BUILDING, YEAR_OF_PLENTY, MONOPOLY, VICTORY_POINT
- **Building Inventory**: Roads, settlements, cities remaining
- **Victory Points**: Current public and total VP counts
- **Special Powers**: Longest road, largest army status

#### Board State Features:
- **Tile Information**: Resource type, number probability, robber location
- **Building Placement**: All settlements, cities, and roads on board
- **Port Information**: Location and type of all trading ports

#### Game State Features:
- **Turn Information**: Current phase, dice roll status

## Agent Implementations

### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent

**Architecture**: 
- **Network**: 3-layer MLP (512→256→128 hidden units)
- **Input**: 1,002-dimensional state vector
- **Output**: 290 Q-values (one per action)
- **Parameters**: ~715,170 trainable parameters

**Key Features**:
- **Experience Replay**: 100,000-step replay buffer
- **Target Network**: Updated every 1,000 steps
- **Action Masking**: Invalid actions set to -∞ Q-value
- **Epsilon-Greedy**: Decaying exploration (0.9 → 0.1)

```python
class MaskedDQNAgent(CatanatronRLAgent):
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim, lr=3e-4, gamma=0.99, epsilon=0.1):
        # Neural network: obs_dim → 512 → 256 → 128 → action_dim
        self.q_network = DQNNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        self.target_network = DQNNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        
    def select_action(self, observation, valid_actions):
        # Epsilon-greedy with action masking
        q_values = self.q_network(observation)
        q_values[invalid_actions] = -float('inf')
        return q_values.argmax() if random.random() > epsilon else random.choice(valid_actions)
```

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Agent

**Architecture**:
- **Actor Network**: 3-layer MLP outputting action probabilities
- **Critic Network**: 3-layer MLP outputting state value estimates
- **Shared Backbone**: Optional shared layers for efficiency

**Key Features**:
- **Clipped Objective**: PPO clipping ratio of 0.2
- **Advantage Estimation**: GAE with λ=0.95
- **Action Masking**: Invalid actions masked in policy distribution
- **Multiple Epochs**: 10 update epochs per rollout

```python
class MaskedPPOAgent(CatanatronRLAgent):
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim, lr=3e-4, gamma=0.99, clip_ratio=0.2):
        self.actor = PolicyNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        self.critic = ValueNetwork(obs_dim)
        
    def select_action(self, observation, valid_actions):
        # Policy with action masking
        logits = self.actor(observation)
        logits[invalid_actions] = -float('inf')
        action_probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        return Categorical(action_probs).sample()
```

## Training Pipeline

### Training Process

The training pipeline (`CatanatronTrainer`) orchestrates the complete learning process:

1. **Environment Setup**: Create Catanatron environment with opponents
2. **Agent Initialization**: Load agent with proper observation/action dimensions
3. **Training Loop**: Execute episodes with experience collection
4. **Model Updates**: Batch learning from collected experiences
5. **Evaluation**: Periodic assessment against test opponents
6. **Checkpointing**: Model saving and progress tracking

### Training Configuration

```python
config = {
    # Learning parameters
    "lr": 3e-4,                    # Learning rate
    "gamma": 0.99,                 # Discount factor
    "epsilon": 0.1,                # Exploration rate (DQN)
    "clip_ratio": 0.2,             # PPO clipping ratio
    
    # Training schedule
    "total_episodes": 20000,       # Total training episodes
    "batch_size": 32,              # Update batch size
    "replay_buffer_size": 100000,  # Experience replay capacity
    
    # Evaluation
    "evaluation_frequency": 1000,   # Episodes between evaluations
    "save_frequency": 2000,        # Episodes between model saves
}
```

### Training Results

Recent training run achieved outstanding performance:

- **Training Duration**: ~20 minutes (333 episodes)
- **Final Win Rate**: **97.0%** against random opponents
- **Average Reward**: 1.60
- **Average Game Length**: 243.8 steps
- **Network Parameters**: 715,170 (DQN)

## Feature Engineering

### State Representation

The observation vector captures comprehensive game state through handcrafted features:

#### Resource Features (40 dims)
```python
# Per-player resource cards (5 resources × 4 players × 2 contexts)
"P0_WOOD_IN_HAND", "P0_BRICK_IN_HAND", ..., "P3_ORE_IN_HAND"
"P0_NUM_RESOURCES_IN_HAND", ..., "P3_NUM_RESOURCES_IN_HAND"
```

#### Building Features (216 dims)
```python
# Building placement on board (54 nodes × 4 players)
"NODE0_P0_SETTLEMENT", "NODE0_P0_CITY", ..., "NODE53_P3_CITY"
# Road placement (72 edges × 4 players)  
"EDGE(0,1)_P0_ROAD", ..., "EDGE(53,54)_P3_ROAD"
```

#### Board Features (150 dims)
```python
# Tile information (19 tiles × 8 features)
"TILE0_IS_WOOD", "TILE0_PROBA", "TILE0_HAS_ROBBER", ...
# Port information (9 ports × 6 types)
"PORT0_IS_WOOD", "PORT0_IS_THREE_TO_ONE", ...
```

#### Game State Features (596 dims)
```python
# Development cards, victory points, special powers
"P0_KNIGHT_IN_HAND", "P0_VICTORY_POINTS", "P0_HAS_ARMY", ...
# Bank status and game phase
"BANK_WOOD", "IS_MOVING_ROBBER", "IS_DISCARDING", ...
```

### Alternative Representations

The system also supports spatial board representations:

#### Board Tensor (21×11×20)
- **Spatial Layout**: 2D grid preserving hexagonal board topology
- **Channels**: Player buildings, resource probabilities, robber, ports
- **Use Case**: Convolutional neural networks for spatial reasoning

## Action Space & Masking

### Action Categories

The 290 discrete actions cover all possible Catan moves:

1. **Basic Actions** (10): Roll dice, end turn, discard
2. **Building Actions** (126): Roads (72) + Settlements/Cities (54)
3. **Development Cards** (10): Buy + play various dev cards
4. **Robber Actions** (19): Move robber to any tile
5. **Trading Actions** (125): All possible maritime trades

### Action Masking

Critical for handling game rules and illegal moves:

```python
def get_valid_actions(self):
    """Return list of currently legal action indices"""
    playable_actions = self.game.state.playable_actions
    valid_indices = []
    
    for i, (action_type, value) in enumerate(ACTIONS_ARRAY):
        if any(normalize_action(a) == (action_type, value) for a in playable_actions):
            valid_indices.append(i)
    
    return valid_indices
```

**Benefits**:
- **Training Stability**: Prevents illegal move penalties
- **Sample Efficiency**: Focuses learning on legal moves
- **Game Compliance**: Ensures valid gameplay

## Reward Design

### Primary Reward Signal

```python
def simple_reward(game, p0_color):
    """Simple win/loss reward"""
    winning_color = game.winning_color()
    if p0_color == winning_color:
        return 1.0      # Victory
    elif winning_color is None:
        return 0.0      # Game ongoing
    else:
        return -1.0     # Defeat
```

### Advanced Reward Shaping

The `CatanatronRewardShaper` provides additional reward signals:

```python
class CatanatronRewardShaper:
    def shape_reward(self, game, action, next_game):
        reward = 0.0
        
        # Victory point progress
        vp_gain = self.get_vp_gain(game, next_game)
        reward += vp_gain * 0.1
        
        # Building bonuses
        if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
            reward += 0.05
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
            reward += 0.1
            
        # Development card bonuses
        if action.action_type == ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD:
            reward += 0.02
            
        return reward
```

game.play()
```

#### Custom Opponent Configuration

```python
# Test against multiple random opponents (easier)
easy_opponents = [RandomPlayer(c) for c in [Color.RED, Color.ORANGE, Color.WHITE]]

# Test against mixed opponents (moderate difficulty)
mixed_opponents = [
    RandomPlayer(Color.RED),
    WeightedRandomPlayer(Color.ORANGE),
    RandomPlayer(Color.WHITE)
]

# Create games with different opponent sets
for opponents in [easy_opponents, mixed_opponents]:
    players = [rl_player] + opponents
    game = Game(players)
    game.play()
    print(f"Winner: {game.winning_color()}")
```

### Evaluation and Testing

# Enable detailed logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Monitor training progress
from step4_training_utilities import TrainingLogger

logger = TrainingLogger("debug_logs", "debug_session")

# Log custom metrics during training
logger.log_training_step(loss=0.5, lr=3e-4, epsilon=0.1)
logger.log_episode(episode=100, reward=1.5, length=250, won=True)
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **CUDA Out of Memory**
   ```python
   # Use CPU instead
   trainer = CatanatronTrainer(device="cpu")
   ```

2. **Model Loading Errors**
   ```python
   # Ensure agent type matches training
   agent = CatanatronRLPlayer(agent_type="dqn")  # Not "DQN"
   ```

3. **Environment Errors**
   ```python
   # Verify Catanatron installation
   import catanatron.gym
   print("Catanatron gym environment available")
   ```

4. **Training Convergence Issues**
   ```python
   # Try different learning rates
   config = {"lr": 1e-4}  # Lower learning rate
   config = {"lr": 1e-3}  # Higher learning rate
   ```

#### Performance Optimization

```python
# For faster training
config = {
    "batch_size": 64,              # Larger batches
    "learning_starts": 500,        # Start learning earlier
    "train_freq": 2,               # Train more frequently
}

# For better sample efficiency
config = {
    "gamma": 0.995,                # Higher discount factor
    "replay_buffer_size": 200000,  # Larger replay buffer
}
```

### Model Deployment

#### For Production Use

```python
from step7_evaluation_deployment import CatanatronDeployment

deployment = CatanatronDeployment(
    model_path="training_outputs/models/best_DQN_model.pt",
    agent_type="dqn"
)

# Export for CLI usage
deployment.export_for_cli("exported_rl_player.py")

# The exported player can be used in Catanatron CLI games
```

#### Integration with External Systems

```python
class CustomRLPlayer:
    def __init__(self, model_path: str):
        self.agent = create_rl_player(
            color=Color.BLUE,
            agent_type="dqn", 
            model_path=model_path,
            training_mode=False
        )
        self.agent.initialize_agent(1002, 290)
    
    def get_action(self, game_state):
        # Convert your game state to Catanatron format
        # and use self.agent.decide()
        pass
```

### Example Training Session

### Monitoring Training Progress

Understanding how your agent is performing during training is crucial for successful RL development. Here's how to monitor and interpret training progress:

#### Training Output Structure

During training, you'll see output like this:

```
INFO:step10_working_training:Starting RL agent training...
INFO:step6_training_pipeline:Setting up Catanatron environment...
INFO:step6_training_pipeline:Environment created with obs_dim=1002, action_dim=290
INFO:step6_training_pipeline:Setting up DQN agent...

Training completed in 1247.55 seconds
Final model saved to training_outputs/models
```

#### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Episode Reward**
   - **Good**: Steadily increasing over time
   - **Concerning**: Constant low values or high variance
   - **Target**: > 1.0 consistently (indicating wins)

2. **Episode Length** 
   - **Good**: Decreasing over time (faster wins)
   - **Normal Range**: 150-300 steps per game
   - **Concerning**: Very short (<100) or very long (>500) games

3. **Win Rate** (during evaluation)
   - **Excellent**: > 80% against random opponents
   - **Good**: 60-80% win rate
   - **Poor**: < 40% win rate

4. **Loss Values**
   - **Good**: Decreasing trend, stabilizing around 0.01-0.1
   - **Concerning**: Increasing or highly unstable
   - **Note**: Some fluctuation is normal

5. **Epsilon** (Exploration Rate)
   - **Expected**: Decreases from 1.0 to ~0.05 over training
   - **Purpose**: Balances exploration vs exploitation

#### Real-Time Monitoring

```python
# Monitor training with custom logging
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import deque

class TrainingMonitor:
    def __init__(self, window_size=100):
        self.rewards = deque(maxlen=window_size)
        self.win_rates = []
        self.losses = deque(maxlen=window_size)
        
    def update(self, reward, loss, win_rate=None):
        self.rewards.append(reward)
        self.losses.append(loss)
        if win_rate is not None:
            self.win_rates.append(win_rate)
    
    def plot_progress(self):
        fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))
        
        # Rewards
        ax1.plot(list(self.rewards))
        ax1.set_title('Episode Rewards (Last 100)')
        ax1.set_ylabel('Reward')
        
        # Losses
        ax2.plot(list(self.losses))
        ax2.set_title('Training Loss (Last 100)')
        ax2.set_ylabel('Loss')
        
        # Win rates
        if self.win_rates:
            ax3.plot(self.win_rates)
            ax3.set_title('Win Rate Over Time')
            ax3.set_ylabel('Win Rate')
        
        # Moving average of rewards
        if len(self.rewards) > 10:
            moving_avg = []
            for i in range(10, len(self.rewards)):
                moving_avg.append(sum(list(self.rewards)[i-10:i]) / 10)
            ax4.plot(moving_avg)
            ax4.set_title('Reward Moving Average')
            ax4.set_ylabel('Avg Reward')
        
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.savefig('training_progress.png')
        plt.show()

# Use during training
monitor = TrainingMonitor()
# Update after each episode: monitor.update(reward, loss)
# Plot periodically: monitor.plot_progress()
```

#### Log File Analysis

Training logs are saved in `training_outputs/logs/training.log`. Key patterns to look for:

```bash
# View recent training progress
tail -f training_outputs/logs/training.log

# Search for evaluation results
grep "Evaluation results" training_outputs/logs/training.log

# Check for errors
grep "ERROR" training_outputs/logs/training.log

# Monitor win rate improvements
grep "New best model saved" training_outputs/logs/training.log
```

#### TensorBoard Integration (Optional)

If you have TensorBoard installed, you can visualize training metrics:

```python
# Add to training script
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter

writer = SummaryWriter('training_outputs/tensorboard')

# Log metrics during training
writer.add_scalar('Episode/Reward', episode_reward, episode)
writer.add_scalar('Episode/Length', episode_length, episode)
writer.add_scalar('Training/Loss', loss, step)
writer.add_scalar('Training/Epsilon', epsilon, episode)

# View in browser
# tensorboard --logdir=training_outputs/tensorboard
```

#### Training Performance Indicators

**🟢 Healthy Training Signs:**
- Rewards trend upward over time
- Win rate increases during evaluations  
- Loss values decrease and stabilize
- Game length decreases (more efficient wins)
- Agent saves new "best" models periodically

**🟡 Warning Signs:**
- Rewards plateau early (< 1.0 average)
- High variance in performance
- Loss values increase or oscillate wildly
- Very long games (> 400 steps) persist

**🔴 Problem Indicators:**
- Rewards remain near 0 after 1000+ episodes
- Win rate < 20% against random opponents
- Loss values explode or become NaN
- Training crashes or hangs

#### Troubleshooting Training Issues

1. **Low Win Rates (<40%)**
   ```python
   # Try these adjustments
   config = {
       "lr": 1e-4,                 # Lower learning rate
       "epsilon": 0.3,             # More exploration initially
       "batch_size": 64,           # Larger batches
       "replay_buffer_size": 200000 # More experience
   }
   ```

2. **Unstable Training**
   ```python
   # Stabilization techniques
   config = {
       "gamma": 0.95,              # Lower discount factor
       "target_update_freq": 500,  # More frequent target updates
       "gradient_clipping": 1.0    # Clip gradients
   }
   ```

3. **Slow Learning**
   ```python
   # Acceleration techniques
   config = {
       "lr": 3e-3,                 # Higher learning rate
       "train_freq": 2,            # Train more often
       "learning_starts": 100      # Start learning earlier
   }
   ```

#### Optimal Training Results

A well-trained agent should achieve:
- **Win Rate**: 85-97% against random opponents
- **Final Reward**: 1.5-2.0 average per episode
- **Game Length**: 150-250 steps average
- **Consistency**: Low variance in performance

#### Post-Training Analysis

After training completes, analyze your model:

```python
# Load training history
import pandas as pd

# If using CSV logging
df = pd.read_csv('training_outputs/logs/catanatron_dqn.csv')

# Plot learning curves
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 5))

plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
plt.plot(df['episode'], df['reward'])
plt.title('Learning Curve')
plt.xlabel('Episode')
plt.ylabel('Reward')

plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
plt.plot(df['episode'], df['loss'])
plt.title('Training Loss')
plt.xlabel('Episode') 
plt.ylabel('Loss')

plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
# Plot win rate if available
if 'win_rate' in df.columns:
    plt.plot(df['episode'], df['win_rate'])
    plt.title('Win Rate')
    plt.xlabel('Episode')
    plt.ylabel('Win Rate')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('training_analysis.png')
plt.show()
```

### Understanding Training Phases

A typical training session goes through these phases:

1. **Exploration Phase** (Episodes 1-50)
   - High epsilon (0.8-1.0)
   - Random-like performance
   - High loss values
   - Learning basic game rules

2. **Learning Phase** (Episodes 50-200)
   - Decreasing epsilon (0.3-0.8)
   - Gradual improvement in rewards
   - Stabilizing loss values
   - Developing basic strategies

3. **Optimization Phase** (Episodes 200-300+)
   - Low epsilon (0.05-0.3)
   - Consistent high performance
   - Low, stable loss values
   - Refining advanced strategies

Expected timeline for 100,000 timesteps (~333 episodes):
- **Phase 1**: Episodes 1-50 (15-20 minutes)
- **Phase 2**: Episodes 50-200 (45-60 minutes) 
- **Phase 3**: Episodes 200+ (30-45 minutes)
- **Total**: ~2-3 hours on CPU, ~1 hour on GPU
