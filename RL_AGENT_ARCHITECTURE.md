- **Multi-player Support**: Handles 2-4 player games with configurable opponents

### Environment Configuration

```python
env_config = {
    "enemies": [
        RandomPlayer(Color.RED),      # Opponent 1
        RandomPlayer(Color.ORANGE),   # Opponent 2  
        RandomPlayer(Color.WHITE)     # Opponent 3
    ],
    "map_type": "BASE",              # Standard Catan board
    "representation": "vector"        # Feature vector representation
}
```

### Observation Space Details

The 1,002-dimensional observation vector includes:

#### Player-Specific Features (per player):
- **Resource Cards**: WOOD, BRICK, SHEEP, WHEAT, ORE quantities
- **Development Cards**: KNIGHT, ROAD_BUILDING, YEAR_OF_PLENTY, MONOPOLY, VICTORY_POINT
- **Building Inventory**: Roads, settlements, cities remaining
- **Victory Points**: Current public and total VP counts
- **Special Powers**: Longest road, largest army status

#### Board State Features:
- **Tile Information**: Resource type, number probability, robber location
- **Building Placement**: All settlements, cities, and roads on board
- **Port Information**: Location and type of all trading ports

#### Game State Features:
- **Turn Information**: Current phase, dice roll status

## Agent Implementations

### Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent

**Architecture**: 
- **Network**: 3-layer MLP (512→256→128 hidden units)
- **Input**: 1,002-dimensional state vector
- **Output**: 290 Q-values (one per action)
- **Parameters**: ~715,170 trainable parameters

**Key Features**:
- **Experience Replay**: 100,000-step replay buffer
- **Target Network**: Updated every 1,000 steps
- **Action Masking**: Invalid actions set to -∞ Q-value
- **Epsilon-Greedy**: Decaying exploration (0.9 → 0.1)

```python
class MaskedDQNAgent(CatanatronRLAgent):
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim, lr=3e-4, gamma=0.99, epsilon=0.1):
        # Neural network: obs_dim → 512 → 256 → 128 → action_dim
        self.q_network = DQNNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        self.target_network = DQNNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        
    def select_action(self, observation, valid_actions):
        # Epsilon-greedy with action masking
        q_values = self.q_network(observation)
        q_values[invalid_actions] = -float('inf')
        return q_values.argmax() if random.random() > epsilon else random.choice(valid_actions)
```

### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Agent

**Architecture**:
- **Actor Network**: 3-layer MLP outputting action probabilities
- **Critic Network**: 3-layer MLP outputting state value estimates
- **Shared Backbone**: Optional shared layers for efficiency

**Key Features**:
- **Clipped Objective**: PPO clipping ratio of 0.2
- **Advantage Estimation**: GAE with λ=0.95
- **Action Masking**: Invalid actions masked in policy distribution
- **Multiple Epochs**: 10 update epochs per rollout

```python
class MaskedPPOAgent(CatanatronRLAgent):
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim, lr=3e-4, gamma=0.99, clip_ratio=0.2):
        self.actor = PolicyNetwork(obs_dim, action_dim)
        self.critic = ValueNetwork(obs_dim)
        
    def select_action(self, observation, valid_actions):
        # Policy with action masking
        logits = self.actor(observation)
        logits[invalid_actions] = -float('inf')
        action_probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)
        return Categorical(action_probs).sample()
```

## Training Pipeline

### Training Process

The training pipeline (`CatanatronTrainer`) orchestrates the complete learning process:

1. **Environment Setup**: Create Catanatron environment with opponents
2. **Agent Initialization**: Load agent with proper observation/action dimensions
3. **Training Loop**: Execute episodes with experience collection
4. **Model Updates**: Batch learning from collected experiences
5. **Evaluation**: Periodic assessment against test opponents
6. **Checkpointing**: Model saving and progress tracking

### Training Configuration

```python
config = {
    # Learning parameters
    "lr": 3e-4,                    # Learning rate
    "gamma": 0.99,                 # Discount factor
    "epsilon": 0.1,                # Exploration rate (DQN)
    "clip_ratio": 0.2,             # PPO clipping ratio
    
    # Training schedule
    "total_episodes": 20000,       # Total training episodes
    "batch_size": 32,              # Update batch size
    "replay_buffer_size": 100000,  # Experience replay capacity
    
    # Evaluation
    "evaluation_frequency": 1000,   # Episodes between evaluations
    "save_frequency": 2000,        # Episodes between model saves
}
```

### Training Results

Recent training run achieved outstanding performance:

- **Training Duration**: ~20 minutes (333 episodes)
- **Final Win Rate**: **97.0%** against random opponents
- **Average Reward**: 1.60
- **Average Game Length**: 243.8 steps
- **Network Parameters**: 715,170 (DQN)

## Feature Engineering

### State Representation

The observation vector captures comprehensive game state through handcrafted features:

#### Resource Features (40 dims)
```python
# Per-player resource cards (5 resources × 4 players × 2 contexts)
"P0_WOOD_IN_HAND", "P0_BRICK_IN_HAND", ..., "P3_ORE_IN_HAND"
"P0_NUM_RESOURCES_IN_HAND", ..., "P3_NUM_RESOURCES_IN_HAND"
```

#### Building Features (216 dims)
```python
# Building placement on board (54 nodes × 4 players)
"NODE0_P0_SETTLEMENT", "NODE0_P0_CITY", ..., "NODE53_P3_CITY"
# Road placement (72 edges × 4 players)  
"EDGE(0,1)_P0_ROAD", ..., "EDGE(53,54)_P3_ROAD"
```

#### Board Features (150 dims)
```python
# Tile information (19 tiles × 8 features)
"TILE0_IS_WOOD", "TILE0_PROBA", "TILE0_HAS_ROBBER", ...
# Port information (9 ports × 6 types)
"PORT0_IS_WOOD", "PORT0_IS_THREE_TO_ONE", ...
```

#### Game State Features (596 dims)
```python
# Development cards, victory points, special powers
"P0_KNIGHT_IN_HAND", "P0_VICTORY_POINTS", "P0_HAS_ARMY", ...
# Bank status and game phase
"BANK_WOOD", "IS_MOVING_ROBBER", "IS_DISCARDING", ...
```

### Alternative Representations

The system also supports spatial board representations:

#### Board Tensor (21×11×20)
- **Spatial Layout**: 2D grid preserving hexagonal board topology
- **Channels**: Player buildings, resource probabilities, robber, ports
- **Use Case**: Convolutional neural networks for spatial reasoning

## Action Space & Masking

### Action Categories

The 290 discrete actions cover all possible Catan moves:

1. **Basic Actions** (10): Roll dice, end turn, discard
2. **Building Actions** (126): Roads (72) + Settlements/Cities (54)
3. **Development Cards** (10): Buy + play various dev cards
4. **Robber Actions** (19): Move robber to any tile
5. **Trading Actions** (125): All possible maritime trades

### Action Masking

Critical for handling game rules and illegal moves:

```python
def get_valid_actions(self):
    """Return list of currently legal action indices"""
    playable_actions = self.game.state.playable_actions
    valid_indices = []
    
    for i, (action_type, value) in enumerate(ACTIONS_ARRAY):
        if any(normalize_action(a) == (action_type, value) for a in playable_actions):
            valid_indices.append(i)
    
    return valid_indices
```

**Benefits**:
- **Training Stability**: Prevents illegal move penalties
- **Sample Efficiency**: Focuses learning on legal moves
- **Game Compliance**: Ensures valid gameplay

## Reward Design

### Primary Reward Signal

```python
def simple_reward(game, p0_color):
    """Simple win/loss reward"""
    winning_color = game.winning_color()
    if p0_color == winning_color:
        return 1.0      # Victory
    elif winning_color is None:
        return 0.0      # Game ongoing
    else:
        return -1.0     # Defeat
```

### Advanced Reward Shaping

The `CatanatronRewardShaper` provides additional reward signals:

```python
class CatanatronRewardShaper:
    def shape_reward(self, game, action, next_game):
        reward = 0.0
        
        # Victory point progress
        vp_gain = self.get_vp_gain(game, next_game)
        reward += vp_gain * 0.1
        
        # Building bonuses
        if action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_SETTLEMENT:
            reward += 0.05
        elif action.action_type == ActionType.BUILD_CITY:
            reward += 0.1
            
        # Development card bonuses
        if action.action_type == ActionType.BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD:
            reward += 0.02
            
        return reward
```
